    <p class="text-xl my-4"><span class="font-bold">VAR: </span>var is a javascript variable used to declare
      variables. var is
      the short form of Variable. it is create with the var keyword and the assignment operator (=) is used to assign
      value to that variable. <br> For an example: var x = 5;<br> But var has some limitations. It is function scoped
      that
      means if a var is declared inside a function then it can be accessible only inside the function. But if it is
      declared outside of the function then it become global scoped. It can be re-declared.</p>
    <p class="text-xl my-4"><span class="font-bold">LET: </span>let is a javascript variable used to declare
      variables. It is a block scope variable. That means it is only accessible within the function , loop or any other
      block that it was declared. let was first introduced in ECMAScript 2015 which is also known as ES6. It provides
      more comfortable way to declare variable compared to var. <br> For an example: let x = 10; <br> It can not be
      re-declared.
      It is more convenient to use let then var.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl my-4"><span class="font-bold">Const: </span>const is a javascript variable used to declare
      variables in block scope. Variable declared with const means it is constant that means the value of the declared
      variable can not be changed. It is also introduced in ECMAScript 2015. Variables which are declared using const
      are immutable which means the values can not be changed once they are declared. <br>
      For an example: const x = 15; <br>
      It also can not be re-declared. It also can not be accessible outside of function , loop or any kind of block.

    <h1 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5 text-blue-700">Use Cases Of NULL And Undefined:</h1>
    <div class="text-xl">
      <p><span class="font-bold">Null: </span></p>
      <p>1. Indicate The Value Null: If there is no value for any variable one can declare the value null of
        the variable intentionally. Example: let array = null;</p>
      <p>2. Clear Object Properties: After set some property to an object It can be cleared by using null.
      </p>
      <p>As A Placeholder: It can be used as a placeholder when working with data structures or arrays to reserve a
        place for a value.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-xl">
      <p class="mb-3 mt-3 font-bold"><span>Undefined:</span></p>
      <p>1. Variable Declaration Without Initialization: If variable is declared but no value is assigned thed it will
        give
        undefined.</p>
      <p>2. Function Parameters: If a function called with more then one arguments but it is provided one parameters
        then
        it will show undefined.</p>
      <p>3. Object Properties: If we want to console a property that is not available in the object then it will show
        undefined.</p>
      <p>4. Return Value: If there is no return statement in the function then it will show undefined.</p>

    <h1 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5 text-blue-700">REST API:</h1>
    <div class="text-xl my-3">
      <p>REST stands for Representational State Transfer which is an architectural style that defines a set of
        constraints to be used for creating web services. API stands for Application Programming Interface. REST API is
        a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing. REST technology is
        generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol technology because REST uses less
        bandwidth. Its used to fetch or give some information from a web service. All communication done via REST API
        uses only HTTP request.</p>
